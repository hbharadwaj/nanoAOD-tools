#    HATS comment: 
# Here is a pyROOT gotcha: once you import anything from ROOT, the ROOT command line options 
# will override anything you've defined with your OptionParser. So if you define something
# in your options like -l, that will conflict with the ROOT option to disable the ROOT 
# splash logo. So we only import ROOT once we've already parsed our options.

###   HATS comment:
# By default, gSystem.CompileMacro will compile your ROOT class, load it on its own, and then delete it
# once your pyROOT script is closed. Instead, we want to be able to just compile it once, keep the
# compiled library, and then we can reuse it again without recompiling it
# This is important if you're going to run this script e.g. in a cluster submission
# because if two parallel processes try to compile the macro simultaneously,
# one process might try overwriting the library while another is trying to load it.
#
# The options we use are:
# g --> compile with debug symbols. This is nice if you have a bug in your macro
# O --> optimize the code. This does something behind the scenes, so why not
# c --> compile the macro only and don't load it. We do this so that if we only want to load it, we can, but if we want to do both, we won't try twice
# k --> keep the compiled library and don't delete it when the pyroot script ends.
